## üöÄ Features

* ü§ñ **Automatic** - Recast can generate a navmesh from any level geometry you throw at it
* üèéÔ∏è **Fast** - swift turnaround times for level designers
* üßò **Flexible** - detailed customization options to suit your specific game's needs.
* üß± **Modular** - choose only the modules you need
* üö´ **Depency-Free** - building Recast & Detour only requires a C++ compiler

Recast Navigation is divided into multiple modules, each contained in its own folder:

- `Recast/` - Navmesh generation
- `Detour/` - Runtime loading of navmesh data, pathfinding, navmesh queries 
- `DetourTileCache/` - Navmesh streaming.  Useful for large levels and open-world games
- `DetourCrowd/` - Agent movement, collision avoidance, and crowd simulation
- `DebugUtils/` - API for drawing debug visualizations of navigation data and behavior
- `Tess/` - Unit tests
- `RecastDemo/` - Standalone demo app showcasing Recast & Detour's functionality

## ‚ö° Getting Started

You can find a comprehensive demo project in the `RecastDemo` folder. Check out [Building.md](Docs/Building.md) for instructions on how to build it.  RecastDemo is showcases all the functionality of the library. If you are new to Recast & Detour, check out [Sample_SoloMesh.cpp](/RecastDemo/Source/Sample_SoloMesh.cpp) to get started with building navmeshes and [NavMeshTesterTool.cpp](/RecastDemo/Source/NavMeshTesterTool.cpp) to see how Detour can be used to find paths.

## ‚öô How it Works

Recast constructs a navmesh through a multi-step mesh rasterization process.

1. First Recast rasterizes the input triangle meshes into voxels.
2. Voxels in areas where agents would not be able to move are filtered and removed.
3. The walkable areas described by the voxel grid are then divided into sets of 2D polygonal regions.
4. The navigation polygons are generated by re-triangulating the generated 2d polygonal regions into a navmesh.

You can use Recast to build a single navmesh, or a tiled navmesh.  Single meshes are suitable for many simple cases and are easy to work with.  Tiled navmeshes are more complex to work with but better support larger, more dynamic environments.  Tiled meshes support features like re-baking, heirarchical path-planning, and navmesh data-streaming.
